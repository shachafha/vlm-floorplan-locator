I am going to show you a photograph taken somewhere on the 700-level floor of the Schapiro CEP SR building. Your job is to extract every relevant visual cue from this image—orientation, nearby objects, signage, architectural features, etc.—so that, later on, I can place this photo precisely on my grid-overlaid floor plan.

Here is what I need you to output, in JSON format. Make each value as specific as possible, and include as many details as are visible in the photo:

{
  "view_type":         <“corridor” | “room doorway” | “wall view” | “stairwell” | “elevator lobby” | “unknown”>,
  "primary_landmarks": [
    {
      "type":           <“door” | “bulletin_board” | “trash_bin” | “sign” | “elev_button” | “wall_feature” | “floor_pattern” | “unknown”>,
      "description":    <e.g. “gray door with ADA button and sign ‘PRESS TO OPERATE DOOR’”>,
      "relative_position": <“left” | “right” | “center” | “background” | “foreground”>,
      "any_text":       <any legible text, such as room number, sign copy, bulletin heading, etc. or empty if none>
    },
    {
      "type":           … (list multiple items)
    },
    …
  ],
  "floor_pattern":     < “plain tile” | “carpet” | “parquet” | “black-white checker tile” | “unknown”>,
  "lighting_ceiling":  <“fluorescent ceiling panels” | “recessed lights” | “natural light source” | “unknown”>,
  "wall_color":        <“white” | “light gray” | “purple accent strip” | “unknown”>,
  "additional_notes":  <any other visual detail that might help locate this photo, e.g. “purple ceiling beam visible at top,” “cluster of magnetic poetry words on the door,” “no window in door,” etc.>
  "image_summary":      <a description of the overall scene>
}

**Instructions:**
1. **view_type**: Decide whether the photo is looking down a corridor, into or at a room entrance, at a blank wall (possibly an elevator lobby), etc.
2. **primary_landmarks**:
   – List every object or feature that can serve as an anchor: doors (and any labels or badges on them), bulletin boards (and any flyers or headings), trash bins, ADA push-buttons, directional signs, ceiling beams, fire alarms, etc.
   – For each, specify roughly where it appears in the frame (left/right/center/background/foreground) and copy any text you can read.
3. **floor_pattern**: Note if the flooring is a black-white checker pattern (common on the main corridor), plain tile, or any other distinctive flooring.
4. **lighting_ceiling**: Describe the visible ceiling lights—panels, spotlights, any damage or discoloration.
5. **wall_color**: For each wall surface you see, name its color (e.g. white paint, light gray paint, purple accent beam).
6. **additional_notes**: Anything else—scratches, rust, scuff marks, posters, magnets on the door—whatever might help later match this vantage to the 700-level blueprint.
7. **image_summary**: Provide a description of the overall scene, summarizing the key visual elements and context.

Fill in every JSON field above as completely as possible. If something is entirely out of frame or unidentifiable, you can use “unknown.” Once you give me this JSON, I will compare those details to my floor plan grid to figure out exactly where on the 700-level it must have been taken.

**Here is the image:**
